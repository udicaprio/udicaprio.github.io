Lipophilicity is one of many parameters involved in the biological activity of drugs. It is assessed by defining the partitioning of a molecule between an organic (i.e. octanol) and a water phase. Nevertheless, octanol is too simple to encode all of the complicated interactions seen in ionic liquids. Moreover, the experimental determination of logP in specific ionic liquid/water systems (logPIL/W) is an arduous and resource-intensive task. Machine learning and hybrid modelling techniques have emerged as essential tools in chemical engineering, providing innovative solutions to complicated physicochemical problems. This study proposes a hybrid model correlating the partitioning of organic molecules in octanol/water with the partitioning in [MeoeMPyrr]<sup>+</sup>[FAP]<sup>-</sup>/water systems. The hybrid model is formed by a first principle and a data-driven part. The first is represented by a group contribution model, the latter is represented by an ensemble of 5 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The model structure with the highest accuracy and generalization properties is searched with 5-fold cross-validation, using hyperparameter optimization.. The prediction capabilities have been evaluated through various metrics, namely the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93), the Mean Squared Error (MSE = 1.8Â·40<sup>-2</sup>) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE = 25%), showing quite good accuracy.
