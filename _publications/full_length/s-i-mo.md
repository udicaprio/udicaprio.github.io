Processes with unknown reactions and limited data are commonplace in the chemical industry. However, modeling and optimizing these processes are challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose the Swarm Intelligence-based Modeling and Optimization (SI-M/O) algorithm to address these challenges. The SI-M/O algorithm integrates swarm intelligence with chemical process fundamentals. This fusion empowers SI-M/O to navigate complex chemical landscapes effectively. Swarm intelligence excels at exploring vast solution spaces and adapting dynamically. When combined with first-principle knowledge of chemical reactions and thermodynamics, SI-M/O not only finds optimal solutions but also considers chemical feasibility and physical constraints. To validate its effectiveness, we applied SI-M/O to optimize a production plant, achieving a substantial 5.3 % productivity increase during preliminary testing. We also designed a user-friendly graphical interface for SI-M/O, enhancing accessibility for researchers and practitioners.
